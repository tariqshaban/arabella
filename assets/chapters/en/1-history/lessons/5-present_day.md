Irbid today combines the bustle of a provincial Middle Eastern town and the youthful nightlife of a typical college
town. The city is home to four major universities: Yarmouk University, Jordan University of Science and Technology,
Irbid National University and Jadara University. In addition, it is home for two campuses of Balqa Applied University
and several private colleges. University Street, which defines the western border of the Yarmouk University campus, is
popular with locals as well as with the occasional foreign visitors who stop by to relax in any of its numerous
restaurants and caf√©s that open late into the night.

Though not usually a major tourist destination itself, Irbid is home to two notable museums: the Museum of Jordanian
Heritage and the Jordan Natural History Museum, both on the campus of Yarmouk University. Furthermore, Irbid's strategic
location in northern Jordan makes it a convenient starting point for tourists interested in seeing the northern Jordan
Valley; visiting Umm Qais, Beit Ras (Capitolias), Pella, Ajloun, Umm el-Jimal, La Foossi baitaras and other historical
sites; or traveling on to Syria.
