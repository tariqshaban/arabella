Irbid became subject to Roman rule in 64 BC, as it was within the state of Syria and its capital, Antioch, and found in
the city caves from the Roman era and a Roman pool of water. There is no evidence of a population in the period between
the first Bronze Age and the Roman era, and it is likely that the cause was an earthquake that dried up the water
sources in the region, and the lack of water remained a major obstacle to life in the region until the Romans came and
were able to bring water from aqueducts in The ground is close to Ramtha and Torah. The Roman era is considered the
Renaissance for the city of Irbid economically, socially and culturally, and the reason for the cityâ€™s commercial
prosperity was its joining the Decapolis Alliance, and its name at that time (Arabella), and the goal of establishing
the Decapolis Alliance was to confront the Nabatean state in southern Jordan, spread Roman culture, and organize trade
relations between it and Rome. In the city there is a large building erected in honor of the Roman Emperor Marcus
Antonius.
